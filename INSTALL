This package requires installation of GMP and PBC. 

-----------
Install GMP
-----------

Most systems include a package for GMP (https://gmplib.org/). To install
from package source see the GMP site. 

To install GMP in Debian / Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

For an RPM installation with YUM:

	sudo yum install gmp-devel

For installation with Fink (http://www.finkproject.org/) on Mac OS X:

	sudo fink install gmp gmp-shlibs

-----------
Install PBC
-----------

To install the PBC library, download the appropriate files for your system
from https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/download.html. PBC has three
dependencies: the gcc compiler, flex (http://flex.sourceforge.net/), and
bison (https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/). See the respective sites for
installation instructions. Most distributions include packages for these
libraries. For example, in Debian / Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison

The PBC source can be compiled and installed using the usual GNU Build
System. Pypbc requires PBC is configured as a shared library and in the
standard library search path. For example, to install PBC in Debian /
Ubuntu:

    sh setup
	./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared
	make
	sudo make install

After installing, you may need to rebuild the search path for libraries:

	sudo ldconfig

Once GMP and PBC are installed, installing pypbc via pip (for Python v3)
is simple:

	sudo pip3 install .
